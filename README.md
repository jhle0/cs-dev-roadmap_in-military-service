# ðŸ“š CS Dev Roadmap During Military Service

A complete roadmap for building solid foundations in **Computer Science**, **software development**, **AI utilization**, and **DevOps** â€” all documented during my military service.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository
This repository is my **personal knowledge base** for studying core development skills and Computer Science fundamentals.  
I will be following a structured roadmap, focusing on:
- **Theory**: Understanding key concepts
- **Practice**: Implementing and experimenting
- **Application**: Real-world examples & projects

---

## ðŸ“… Study Approach
Each topic will be studied in **3 steps**:
1. **Theory** â€“ Read and summarize from books, online resources, and documentation
2. **Practice** â€“ Implement related code or experiments
3. **Application** â€“ Apply concepts to mini projects or real-world examples

**Workflow**:
- Select one topic at a time from the roadmap
- Organize notes in Markdown under the corresponding folder
- Commit regularly with clear, descriptive messages

- **Networking**: OSI/TCP-IP layers, physical/data link/network/transport/application layers, routing, NAT, TCP/UDP, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, gRPC, WebSocket, SSL/TLS, CDN, load balancing, Wireshark packet analysis, TCP/UDP socket programming
- **Operating Systems**: OS basics, process/thread, CPU scheduling, synchronization, deadlock, memory management, paging, segmentation, virtual memory, page replacement, file systems, I/O systems, lock-free techniques, RAID
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Time complexity, arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, deques, hash tables, trees, graphs, heaps, sorting, searching, graph algorithms, DP, backtracking, greedy, string matching, union-find, topological sort
- **Compiler/Language Processing Basics**: Tokenization, parsing, interpreter vs compiler (basics only)

### 2. Practical Development Skills
- **Databases**: RDB (MySQL/PostgreSQL), SQL (CRUD, JOIN, INDEX), transactions, ACID, query optimization, NoSQL (MongoDB), ERD modeling, ORM basics, sharding/replication
- **Version Control (Git/GitHub)**: Git commands, branching strategies, PR & code review, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- **Testing**: Unit testing (Pytest/JUnit), integration & E2E testing, CI pipeline automation, TDD concept
- **Security**: Authentication/authorization (JWT, OAuth2), hashing/encryption (SHA, AES), web attacks (SQLi, XSS, CSRF), HTTPS/SSL/TLS, 2FA basics, security design principles, CSRF token verification practice
- **Software Design**: Design patterns (MVC, MVVM), REST API design, modularity & reusability, MSA basics, UML & sequence diagrams

### 3. AI Utilization Skills
