## 2.1 OSI 7 Layers

1. **Application Layer** – Services directly interacting with the user (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS)
2. **Presentation Layer** – Data representation, encoding, compression, encryption (SSL, JPEG, MPEG)
3. **Session Layer** – Connection management, synchronization, dialog control (NetBIOS, RPC)
4. **Transport Layer** – Reliability, flow control, ports (TCP, UDP)
5. **Network Layer** – Addressing, routing, path selection (IP, ICMP, ARP)
6. **Data Link Layer** – Frame delivery based on MAC addresses, error detection (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
7. **Physical Layer** – Bit transmission, electrical/optical signals, cables (Ethernet PHY, RS-232)

## 2.2 TCP/IP 4 Layers

1. **Application Layer** – HTTP, DNS, SMTP, FTP (corresponds to OSI layers 5–7)
2. **Transport Layer** – TCP, UDP (port-based, reliable vs. connectionless)
3. **Internet Layer** – IP, ICMP, ARP, routing (corresponds to OSI Network layer)
4. **Network Access (Link) Layer** – Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC addressing (corresponds to OSI Data Link + Physical)

## 2.3 OSI vs TCP/IP Mapping

- **OSI 7 Layers**: Educational, conceptually detailed separation.
- **TCP/IP 4 Layers**: Practical, actually used in today’s Internet stack.

| OSI 7 Layers | TCP/IP 4 Layers | Example Protocols |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7. Application | **Application** | HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP |
| 6. Presentation | ↘ | (SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG) |
| 5. Session | ↘ | (RPC, NetBIOS) |
| 4. Transport | **Transport** | TCP, UDP |
| 3. Network | **Internet** | IP, ICMP, ARP |
| 2. Data Link | **Network Access** | Ethernet, Wi-Fi |
| 1. Physical | ↘ | Cables, signals |

→ Presentation and Session layers are absorbed into the Application layer in TCP/IP.

## 2.4 Encapsulation & Decapsulation

- **Encapsulation:** The process at the sender where each lower layer adds its own header (and sometimes trailer) to the upper-layer data to form a packet.
    - Example: Application Data → TCP Segment → IP Packet → Ethernet Frame → Physical Signal.
- **Decapsulation:** The process at the receiver where each layer strips its own header, passing the remaining data up to the higher layer.
