> - Describe in an A–B–C topology when the **hidden terminal problem** occurs, and explain why CSMA/CD struggles to solve it.
> - 802.11 uses CSMA/CA instead of CSMA/CD. Explain at least two reasons for this, from the perspective of why collision *detection* is difficult.
> - In a cellular network, explain the roles of the **cell**, **base station**, and **core network** in terms of how user data flows through the system.
> - Why does TCP often misinterpret losses on a wireless link as **congestion**? Relate your answer to TCP’s design assumption that “loss ≈ congestion.”

## 7.1 Overview of Wireless Networks

### Components of a Wireless Network

A wireless network is composed of **wireless hosts**, **wireless links**, **base stations**, and the **network infrastructure**.

Together, these components form the wireless communication environment on top of the underlying (often wired) network, enabling end-to-end data transmission.

### Wireless Host

- A **wireless host** is an end system that runs applications, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and IoT devices.
- It typically communicates with a base station or other wireless hosts over a **wireless link**.

### Wireless Link

- A **wireless link** is the communication path that connects a wireless host to the **network infrastructure or another host**.
- Wireless links are used not only at the edge of the network (access networks) but also in parts of the backbone.
- Link quality depends on factors such as **transmission distance, obstacles, interference, and transmit power**.

### Base Station

- A **base station** mediates the **transmission and reception of data** between wireless hosts and the network.
- Examples:
  - **Cell towers** in cellular networks
  - **Access Points (APs)** in Wi-Fi networks
- Being **associated** with a base station means:
  1. The host is within that base station’s wireless coverage area, and  
  2. It sends and receives data to/from the network **through** that base station.

### Infrastructure-Based Network

- In an infrastructure-based network, wireless hosts connect to the Internet **via a base station**.
- The base station relays services such as address assignment, routing, and DNS.
- Wi-Fi, LTE, and 5G are all examples of infrastructure-based wireless networks.

### Ad Hoc Network

- In an **ad hoc network**, there is **no base station**; hosts connect directly to one another.
- Each host must handle functions such as **routing, address management, and name resolution** by itself.
- Examples include military communication networks, disaster recovery networks, and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).

### Handoff (Handover)

- A **handoff (handover)** is the procedure of changing the network attachment point when
  a mobile host moves out of one base station’s coverage area and into another’s.
- In cellular networks, handovers are performed automatically so that ongoing voice calls
  or data sessions are maintained without being dropped.

### Classification of Wireless Networks

Wireless networks can be classified along two dimensions:

1. **Number of hops**: single-hop vs. multi-hop  
2. **Presence of infrastructure**: with infrastructure vs. without infrastructure  

**Single-hop + Infrastructure**

- All communication between hosts and the network
