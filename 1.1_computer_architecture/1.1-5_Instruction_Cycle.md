→ The **instruction cycle** is the overall process by which the CPU fetches an instruction from memory, decodes it, and executes it.

---

## Fetch (Instruction Fetch)

- The **Program Counter (PC)** provides the address of the next instruction to the **Memory Address Register (MAR)**.
- The instruction at that address is read from memory into the **Memory Data Register (MDR)**.
- The MDR transfers the instruction into the **Instruction Register (IR)**.
- The PC is then updated to point to the next instruction.

---

## Decode (Instruction Decode)

- The **Control Unit (CU)** interprets the contents of the IR.
- It determines **which operation to perform** and **where the operands are located**.
- If necessary, it prepares access to the ALU, registers, or memory.

---

## Execute (Instruction Execution)

- The **ALU** performs arithmetic or logical operations.
- If the instruction requires memory access, data is read or written.
- The result is stored back into a register or memory.
- The **flag register (e.g., ZF, CF, OF)** is updated based on the result.

### Data Flow Summary

**PC → MAR → MDR → IR (Fetch)** → **CU decodes → ALU/Registers perform operation (Decode & Execute)**
