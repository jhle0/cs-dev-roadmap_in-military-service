# Computer System Organization (CPU, Memory, I/O)


> Active recall
> 
> - Define the roles of **CPU**, **memory**, and **I/O** in one sentence each.
> - State what the **address/data/control buses** carry.
> - Describe the **memory read/write cycles** in signal order.
> - Define **MMIO** in one line.

### CPU

- The **brain** of the computer.
- **Decodes instructions, performs arithmetic/logic, and orchestrates the system.**
    - Composed of a **register file** (incl. PC, IR), **ALU**, and **control unit**.

### Memory (RAM)

- The workspace that **stores instructions and data** so the CPU can **access them by address**.

### I/O Devices

- Components that **exchange data with the outside world**.
    - Typically connected via an **I/O controller** to the CPU and memory.
    - Examples: keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, **storage** (HDD/SSD/USB), **network** interfaces, etc.

## Buses: Address, Data, Control

- **Address Bus** — *Where*: a **unidirectional** path driven by a **bus master** (usually the CPU, sometimes DMA) toward RAM or I/O controllers.
- **Data Bus** — *What*: a **bidirectional** path that carries actual **data/instructions** (read: device→CPU, write: CPU→device/memory).
- **Control Bus** — *When/How*: carries **READ/WRITE**, **interrupt request**, **bus request/grant**, **ready/wait**, reset/clock and other timing/arbitration signals.

## Memory Access Cycles

**READ**

1. CPU drives the **address bus** with the target address.
2. CPU asserts **Memory Read** on the **control bus**.
3. The memory (or device register) **drives the data bus** with the value.
4. The CPU **latches** the value into a register (e.g., MDR/R1).
5. Control/address lines are released; the cycle ends.

**WRITE**

1. CPU drives the **address bus** with the destination address.
2. CPU drives the **data bus** with the value to write.
3. CPU asserts **Memory Write** on the **control bus**.
4. The memory **latches** the value into the addressed cell (edge-aligned if synchronous).
5. Signals are released; the cycle ends.

## I/O Access Modes

- **MMIO (Memory-Mapped I/O):** device controller **registers occupy part of the address space**; the CPU accesses them with ordinary loads/stores just like memory.
- **PIO (Port-mapped I/O / IN–OUT):** some ISAs use **dedicated instructions** (e.g., IN/OUT) to access device ports.

- **Typical I/O controller registers**
    - **DATA** – buffer for data exchanged between CPU and device
    - **STATUS** – indicates ready/busy, completion, errors, etc.
    - **CONTROL** – holds control bits/commands telling the device what to do
