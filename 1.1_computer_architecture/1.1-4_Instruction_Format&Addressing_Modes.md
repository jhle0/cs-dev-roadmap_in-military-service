## Instruction Format

A CPU instruction typically consists of **an operation code (OpCode)** and **operands**:

- **OpCode**: Specifies the operation (e.g., ADD, SUB, MOV).
- **Operand**: Specifies the target (data or address).
- **Additional fields**: May include addressing mode, register identifiers, etc.

⇒ The CPU interprets the instruction bits to understand **“what operation + which data.”**

## Addressing Modes

method of interpreting an instruction’s operand to determine where to obtain the data needed for the operation — in other words, *“where to find the data.”*

### (1) Immediate Addressing

- The actual data value is embedded in the instruction.
    - Fastest (no memory access).
    - Limited by instruction length.

### (2) Direct Addressing

- The instruction directly contains a memory address.
    - Simple but increases instruction size.
    - Rarely used in modern CPUs.

### (3) Indirect Addressing

- The operand points not to the data itself, but to the **address where the data resides**.
    - Essentially an **“address of an address.”**
    - Conceptually similar to pointer dereferencing.

### (4) Register Addressing

- The operand specifies a particular register that holds the data.
    - Very fast (no memory access).
    - Register allocation is key to CPU performance.

### (5) Displacement Addressing

- The effective address is computed as **Base Register + Offset**.
    - Used for arrays, structures, and local variables.
    - Extremely common in compiled code (e.g., `arr[i]`, `struct.member`).

### (6) Stack Addressing

- Operands are accessed relative to the **Stack Pointer (SP)**, typically with PUSH/POP.
    - Essential for function calls, local variables, and return addresses.
    - Effectively a specialized form of **SP-based displacement addressing**.
